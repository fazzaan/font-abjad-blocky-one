# font-abjad-blocky-one
Font for abjad-like conscript "Blocky One", nothing special, just a functional proof of concept.

* _This font is currently only available in OTF; it may not render consonant diacritics correctly in MS Word [this is Microsoft's fault]._  
* _I have recently created a [Latin glyphâ€“based variant](https://github.com/fazzaan/font-abjoid-latinate-one) of the underlying abjoid conscript._
* Explore my Abjoid Conscript [here](https://github.com/fazzaan/abjoid-distribution).  

One use for this font is: helping people to become familiar with the script _style_, kinda like training wheels, before attempting to tackle Arabic.
