# font-abjad-blocky-one
Font for abjad-like conscript "Blocky One", nothing special, just a functional proof of concept.

_This font is currently only available in OTF; it may not render consonant diacritics correctly in MS Word [this is Microsoft's fault]._

One use for this font is: helping people to become familiar with the script _style_, kinda like training wheels, before attempting to tackle Arabic.

This is a famous movie quote. Can you read it?
